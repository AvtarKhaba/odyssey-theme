      Meet Avtar Khaba - Founder & CEO
      With over three decades of experience, I have designed, implemented, and managed complex digital transformation projects using cutting-edge technology across various industries, including the public sector, defence, retail, technology, financial services, and professional services. This work has enabled organizations such as Deloitte, The British Army, NatWest, the Scottish Government, BAE Systems, the NHS, and the UK Home Office to maximize their technology investments, boost efficiency, foster innovation, and leverage strategic partnerships to achieve their business goals.
      
      Do you or your organisation use the Co-Authoring feature in Microsoft Office?
      
      One of my most notable achievements is developing the prototype for the Co-Authoring feature in Microsoft Office, enabling real-time collaboration within documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. At a time when the idea seemed radical and many in the industry believed it was impossible, I secured angel funding and initiated the patent process. This patent and technology were later acquired by Microsoft and integrated into what is now known as Co-Authoring in Microsoft Office.

      As the Founder and CEO of TopDown Tech, my goal is to help C-suite leaders maximize their technology investments by bringing innovative thinking and practical implementation to their organizations.
